              Have you ever noticed your body moving along to a song's rhythm
              unconsciously? Do you ever find yourself nodding your head to
              music without even realizing it?

            <p>
              In 2015, researchers at the University of Oslo tasked
              participants, including NM0004S4, with standing completely still
              while listening to different sound stimuli. The objective was to
              examine the effects of music stimuli on movement, mainly how the
              stimuli would induce involuntary motion even when participants
              tried to remain perfectly still. Their motion data were recorded
              using a high-precision camera system with millimeter resolution.

              During a minute of complete silence, their average displacement
              was 3.772 mm/s, indicating that maintaining absolute stillness is
              difficult even without sound.

              When exposed to music, such as EDM, NM0004S4's average
              displacement rose to 7.458 mm/s, reflecting a stronger,
              rhythmically induced motion.
